# UWFintech_Challenge_20
## Project Description
In this project I create a joint savings account smart contract using solidity and the Remix - Ethereum IDE. The compiled contract is compiled and deployed on the JavaScript VM and the contract functionalities were tested. Screenshots of the working call functions are saved in the Execute Results Folder.

## Technologies
**Solidity 0.5.0**  
**Remix - Ethereum IDE**  

## Installation Guide
Add the code, compile the code, and deploy the contract using the Remix IDE. The Remix IDE is a browser based IDE - the link is below.
